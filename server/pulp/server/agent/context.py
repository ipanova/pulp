    The context bundles together all of the information needed to invoke the
    remote method on the agent and where the asynchronous reply is to be sent.
    Further, gofer supports including arbitrary information to be round tripped.
    This is contextual information that the asynchronous reply handler will need
    to process the reply.  The context also determines the agent UUID based on the
    consumer ID.  It also generates the shared secret based on the SHA256 hex
    digest of the consumer certificate. We include such things as: The task_id and in
    some cases DB entity IDs so we can update the DB based on the result of the
    operation on the agent.

    :ivar uuid: The agent UUID.
